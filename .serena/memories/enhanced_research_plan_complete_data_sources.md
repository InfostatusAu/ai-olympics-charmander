# Enhanced Research Plan: Complete Data Source Implementation + LLM Intelligence

## Overview
Updated the specs/002-improve-research-with-llm/plan.md to include ALL missing components from prospect_research_approach.md. The plan now covers complete implementation of the research approach with graceful error handling.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Complete Data Source Coverage
Added implementation for ALL 9 data sources specified in prospect_research_approach.md:
- Firecrawl (existing, enhanced)
- Apollo.io API (NEW - contact enrichment)
- Serper API (NEW - alternative search) 
- Playwright MCP (NEW - authenticated browsing)
- LinkedIn (enhanced with authentication)
- Job Boards (enhanced: Seek, Indeed, Glassdoor)
- News & Search (enhanced)
- Government Registries (enhanced)

### 2. Error Resilience Strategy
- Each data source failure is logged but doesn't stop the process
- Process continues collecting from remaining sources
- LLM analyzes ALL available data regardless of individual source failures
- Comprehensive fallback to manual processing if LLM fails

### 3. Priority Implementation Order
Phase 1: Apollo.io + Playwright MCP (highest impact)
Phase 2: Serper + Glassdoor (enhanced capabilities)  
Phase 3: LLM intelligence layer (synthesis)

### 4. Technical Architecture
- New src/data_sources/ module with 9 source implementations
- Enhanced src/llm_enhancer/ for comprehensive analysis
- Complete API configuration in MCP server
- Environment variables for all required credentials

### 5. Performance & Quality Targets
- <120 seconds for complete analysis (all 9 sources)
- Data quality scoring based on successful source collection
- Detailed reporting of source success/failure rates
- Authentication handling for login-required platforms

## Next Steps
The plan is now ready for task breakdown and implementation. All gaps identified in the original prospect research approach have been addressed with proper error handling and LLM enhancement integration.
