# Generate strategic profile with AI
analyzer = ProfileAnalyzer(client)
profile = await analyzer.generate_profile(research_data, template)
```

### Middleware Coordination
```python
# Coordinate AI enhancement with fallback
middleware = LLMMiddleware(client)
enhanced_data = await middleware.enhance_with_fallback(raw_data)
```
