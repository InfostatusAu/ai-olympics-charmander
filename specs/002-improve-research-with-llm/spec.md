# Feature Specification: Improve Research with LLM

**Feature Branch**: `002-improve-research-with-llm`  
**Created**: September 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to improve the current MCP server prospect research with the power of LLM. Now tools in the MCP are working but just normal programming with static APIs request. Leverage the power of LLM to improve those tools results."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: enhance existing MCP tools with LLM intelligence
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: existing MCP tools, LLM providers, prospect research analysts
   → Actions: enhance analysis, improve results, add intelligence 
   → Data: existing research data, LLM processed insights
   → Constraints: maintain existing tool interfaces, preserve performance
3. For each unclear aspect: marked with specific questions
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section with realistic workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements with testable criteria
6. Identify Key Entities for LLM integration
7. Run Review Checklist - spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a sales development representative using the MCP prospect research server, I want the content generation tools (`research_prospect` and `create_profile`) to provide more intelligent and contextually rich analysis so that I can better understand prospects' pain points, decision-making processes, and business priorities to create more effective outreach strategies, while keeping data retrieval tools unchanged since the client AI agent can process that data directly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I run `research_prospect` on a company, **When** the tool processes raw data sources, **Then** it provides AI-enhanced insights including business priority analysis, technology readiness assessment, and competitive landscape positioning in the generated markdown report
2. **Given** I use `create_profile` with research data, **When** the LLM processes the context, **Then** it generates sophisticated conversation strategies, personalized talking points, and timing recommendations based on business cycles in the profile markdown
3. **Given** I search prospects using `search_prospects`, **When** the tool queries the database, **Then** it continues to provide the same structured data response without LLM processing since the client AI agent can interpret results
4. **Given** I retrieve data with `get_prospect_data`, **When** the tool returns prospect information, **Then** it provides the same raw research and profile data without additional LLM synthesis since the client AI agent handles analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when LLM API calls fail or timeout during content generation?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from LLM providers for research and profile generation?
- What occurs when research data quality is insufficient for meaningful LLM analysis?
- How does the system maintain performance when generating LLM-enhanced content for multiple prospects?
- What happens when fallback static analysis produces different results than LLM-enhanced content?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enhance the `research_prospect` tool with LLM-powered analysis that synthesizes raw data sources into business intelligence insights in the generated markdown report
- **FR-002**: System MUST improve the `create_profile` tool with AI-generated conversation strategies, personalized messaging recommendations, and optimal timing analysis in the profile markdown
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve the existing `search_prospects` tool functionality without LLM enhancement since client AI agents can process the structured search results directly
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain the existing `get_prospect_data` tool functionality without LLM enhancement since client AI agents can synthesize the raw research and profile data
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing MCP tool interfaces and maintain backward compatibility with current implementations for all four tools
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement configurable LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) with fallback mechanisms for content generation tools only
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain tool response times under 10 seconds for LLM-enhanced content generation operations (`research_prospect`, `create_profile`)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide intelligent error handling when LLM services are unavailable, falling back to original static analysis for content generation tools
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate more sophisticated pain point analysis in research reports by understanding business context, industry trends, and technology adoption patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST create enhanced decision maker insights in profiles including influence mapping, communication preferences, and optimal approach strategies
- **FR-011**: System MUST analyze competitive positioning and market dynamics in research reports to inform prospect engagement strategies
- **FR-012**: System MUST extract and synthesize business priorities from news, job postings, and company communications using natural language understanding in research content
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement secure handling of LLM API keys and sensitive prospect data for content generation operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide detailed logging and observability for LLM content generation operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST support comparison between original static analysis and LLM-enhanced content for quality assessment

### Key Entities
- **LLM Provider**: Configuration for OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLM services with API credentials and model selection for content generation
- **Enhanced Research Report**: AI-processed markdown reports with business intelligence insights, competitive analysis, and sophisticated pain point identification
- **Enhanced Profile**: LLM-generated profiles with conversation strategies, relationship mapping, and personalized outreach recommendations 
- **Content Generation Pipeline**: Processing component that routes raw research data through appropriate LLM prompts for analysis and synthesis
- **Fallback Handler**: Error management system that maintains original static analysis when LLM services are unavailable
