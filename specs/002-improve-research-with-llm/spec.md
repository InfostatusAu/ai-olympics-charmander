# Feature Specification: Improve Research with LLM

**Feature Branch**: `002-improve-research-with-llm`  
**Created**: September 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to improve the current MCP server prospect research with the power of LLM. Now tools in the MCP are working but just normal programming with static APIs request. Leverage the power of LLM to improve those tools results."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: enhance existing MCP tools with LLM intelligence
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: existing MCP tools, LLM providers, prospect research analysts
   → Actions: enhance analysis, improve results, add intelligence 
   → Data: existing research data, LLM processed insights
   → Constraints: maintain existing tool interfaces, preserve performance
3. For each unclear aspect: marked with specific questions
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section with realistic workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements with testable criteria
6. Identify Key Entities for LLM integration
7. Run Review Checklist - spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a sales development representative using the MCP prospect research server, I want the research tools to provide more intelligent and contextually rich analysis so that I can better understand prospects' pain points, decision-making processes, and business priorities to create more effective outreach strategies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I run `research_prospect` on a company, **When** the tool processes raw data sources, **Then** it provides AI-enhanced insights including business priority analysis, technology readiness assessment, and competitive landscape positioning
2. **Given** I use `create_profile` with research data, **When** the LLM processes the context, **Then** it generates sophisticated conversation strategies, personalized talking points, and timing recommendations based on business cycles
3. **Given** I search prospects using `search_prospects`, **When** the tool queries the database, **Then** it provides semantic search capabilities that understand business context and intent rather than just keyword matching
4. **Given** I retrieve data with `get_prospect_data`, **When** the LLM synthesizes information, **Then** it provides executive summaries, key relationship maps, and strategic conversation guides

### Edge Cases
- What happens when LLM API calls fail or timeout?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from LLM providers?
- What occurs when research data quality is insufficient for meaningful LLM analysis?
- How does the system maintain performance when processing large volumes of prospect data?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enhance the `research_prospect` tool with LLM-powered analysis that synthesizes raw data sources into business intelligence insights
- **FR-002**: System MUST improve the `create_profile` tool with AI-generated conversation strategies, personalized messaging recommendations, and optimal timing analysis
- **FR-003**: System MUST upgrade the `search_prospects` tool with semantic search capabilities that understand business context and prospect intent
- **FR-004**: System MUST augment the `get_prospect_data` tool with LLM-generated executive summaries and strategic relationship mapping
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing MCP tool interfaces and maintain backward compatibility with current implementations
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement configurable LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) with fallback mechanisms
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain tool response times under 10 seconds for LLM-enhanced operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide intelligent error handling when LLM services are unavailable, falling back to original static analysis
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate more sophisticated pain point analysis by understanding business context, industry trends, and technology adoption patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST create decision maker insights including influence mapping, communication preferences, and optimal approach strategies
- **FR-011**: System MUST analyze competitive positioning and market dynamics to inform prospect engagement strategies
- **FR-012**: System MUST extract and synthesize business priorities from news, job postings, and company communications using natural language understanding
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement secure handling of LLM API keys and sensitive prospect data
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide detailed logging and observability for LLM enhancement operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST support A/B testing between original static analysis and LLM-enhanced results for performance comparison

### Key Entities
- **LLM Provider**: Configuration for OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLM services with API credentials and model selection
- **Enhanced Analysis**: AI-processed insights including business priority scoring, technology readiness assessment, and competitive positioning
- **Conversation Strategy**: LLM-generated outreach recommendations including messaging themes, timing optimization, and relationship mapping
- **Semantic Search Index**: Vector-based search capabilities for understanding prospect context and business intent
- **Intelligence Layer**: Processing component that routes raw research data through appropriate LLM prompts for analysis enhancement
