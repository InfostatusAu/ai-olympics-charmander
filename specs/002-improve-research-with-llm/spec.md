# Feature Specification: Improve Research with LLM

**Feature Branch**: `002-improve-research-with-llm`  
**Created**: September 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft

## User Story

As a sales development representative using the MCP prospect research server, I want the content generation tools (`research_prospect` and `create_profile`) to provide more intelligent and contextually rich analysis so that I can better understand prospects' pain points, decision-making processes, and business priorities to create more effective outreach strategies, while keeping data retrieval tools unchanged since the client AI agent can process that data directly.

## Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Enhanced Research**: `research_prospect` provides AI-enhanced insights including business priority analysis, technology readiness assessment, and competitive landscape positioning
2. **Enhanced Profiles**: `create_profile` generates sophisticated conversation strategies, personalized talking points, and timing recommendations based on business cycles
3. **Unchanged Search**: `search_prospects` continues providing structured data response without LLM processing
4. **Unchanged Data**: `get_prospect_data` provides raw research and profile data without additional LLM synthesis

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: `research_prospect` generates LLM-enhanced business intelligence insights
- **FR-002**: `create_profile` creates AI-generated conversation strategies
- **FR-003**: `search_prospects` preserves original functionality (no LLM enhancement)
- **FR-004**: `get_prospect_data` preserves original functionality (no LLM enhancement)
- **FR-005**: All MCP tool interfaces remain backward compatible
- **FR-006**: Configurable LLM providers with fallback mechanisms
- **FR-007**: Response times under 10 seconds for enhanced tools
- **FR-008**: Intelligent error handling with fallback to static analysis

### Key Entities
- **LLM Provider**: Configuration for AWS Bedrock with API credentials and model selection
- **Enhanced Research Report**: AI-processed markdown reports with business intelligence insights
- **Enhanced Profile**: LLM-generated profiles with conversation strategies and personalized recommendations 
- **Content Generation Pipeline**: Component that routes raw research data through LLM prompts
- **Fallback Handler**: Error management system that maintains original static analysis when LLM services are unavailable
