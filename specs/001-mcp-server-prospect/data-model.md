# Data Model Prospect Research (Markdown-First)

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Feature**: MCP Server Prospect Research  
**Phase**: 1 - Minimal Data Model for AI-Generated Reports

## Design Philosophy

**PRIMARY OUTPUT**: AI-generated markdown reports with research findings  
**DATABASE ROLE**: Minimal metadata tracking only  
**DEV EFFORT**: Focus on AI logic, not complex database operations  

## Core Entity: Prospect

Ultra-minimal database entity for basic tracking only.

**Fields**:
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
- `company_name`: VARCHAR(255) (Required)
- `domain`: VARCHAR(255) (Unique)
- `status`: ENUM('researched', 'in_progress') DEFAULT 'in_progress'
- `created_at`: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

**That's it!** No complex relationships, no workflow tracking, no JSON blobs.

## File System: AI-Generated Markdown Content

The real value is in AI-generated markdown files stored in the filesystem:

### File Structure
```
/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icp.md                                    # Single ICP definition (version controlled)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prospects/

## Conversation Strategy

### Primary Talking Points
1. **üéØ Series A Growth Challenges** (94% relevance)
   "Congratulations on the $15M Series A! With that growth trajectory, manual data operations typically become the biggest bottleneck. How is TechCorp handling the increased processing volume?"

2. **‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Migration Timing** (91% relevance)  
   "I noticed you're migrating to AWS infrastructure. Perfect timing for document automation integration - our AWS-native architecture scales seamlessly with cloud growth."

3. **ü§ñ AI Team Efficiency** (88% relevance)
   "Your AI engineering hiring spree caught my attention. Data scientists typically spend 60% of their time on data preparation - our automation could free them up for actual model development."

### Conversation Openers
- **Recent TechCrunch Feature**: "Saw the TechCrunch piece on your AI innovation..."
- **CTO LinkedIn Activity**: "Jane's post about AI compliance really resonated..."
- **Funding Announcement**: "Congratulations on the Series A milestone..."

### 3. ICP Reference (`/data/icp.md`)
**Purpose**: Ideal Customer Profile criteria for prospect evaluation  
**Managed by**: Business team (version controlled)  
**Used by**: Research tools for qualification and focus

**Content**: Existing ICP definition from `/gemini-docs/ICP.md`

## File Naming Convention

Files use prospect UUID for consistency and uniqueness:
```
{prospect_id}_research.md
{prospect_id}_profile.md
```

Where `prospect_id` is the UUID from the prospects table.
