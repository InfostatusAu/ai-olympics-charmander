# Workflow Specification: Simplified 2-Step Markdown-First Process

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Feature**: MCP Server Prospect Research Workflow  
**Phase**: 1 - Simplified Workflow and Process Design  
**Update**: Merged profile+strategy for 2-step workflow

## Overview

The prospect research automation follows a streamlined 2-step process that creates **human-readable markdown files** with rich business intelligence for Infostatus sales teams.

## Core Architecture

**Database Role**: Minimal metadata tracking only  
**File System Role**: Rich AI-generated content storage  
**Output Focus**: Copy-paste ready markdown reports with centralized calling strategy  

## The Simplified 2-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Comprehensive Research
**Purpose**: Gather research data and generate comprehensive markdown research report  
**Executor**: AI Agent using MCP `research_prospect` tool  
**Database**: Create/update minimal prospect record with research_status='researched'  
**Output**: Rich markdown file `/data/prospects/{id}_research.md`  

### Step 2: Profile + Strategy Generation  
**Purpose**: Transform research into structured mini profile table with conversation strategy  
**Executor**: AI Agent using MCP `create_profile` tool  
**Database**: Update prospect record metadata  
**Output**: Combined markdown file `/data/prospects/{id}_profile.md` containing mini profile table and talking points  

**Process**:
1. AI agent receives company identifier (name or domain)
2. MCP tool gathers data from multiple sources:
   - Direct API calls for official company data
   - Firecrawl for website content and public information
   - Playwright fallback for complex sites
3. AI generates comprehensive markdown research report with:
   - Company overview and background
   - Recent developments and news
   - Technology stack analysis
   - Decision maker identification
   - Pain points and challenges
   - Source attribution and metadata

**Example Output** (`{id}_research.md`):
```markdown
# Company Research: TechCorp Inc

### Step 2: Profile + Strategy Generation  
**Purpose**: Transform research markdown into structured Mini Profile table with conversation strategy  
**Executor**: AI Agent using MCP `create_profile` tool  
**File Input**: Read `/data/prospects/{id}_research.md`  
**Output**: Combined markdown file `/data/prospects/{id}_profile.md`  

**Process**:
1. AI agent reads the research markdown file
2. Analyzes unstructured research content
3. Generates structured Mini Profile with exactly 14 standardized fields (table format)
4. Creates conversation strategy with personalized talking points
5. Combines both sections into single markdown file

**Example Output** (`{id}_profile.md`):
```markdown
## Mini Profile â€“ TechCorp Inc

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Company Name** | Name of the company | "TechCorp Inc" |
| **Size** | Number of employees | 150 |
| **Revenue Range** | Estimated revenue | $10M-$25M |
| **Industry** | Sector | SaaS/AI Technology |
| **Location** | Main location | San Francisco, CA |
| **Hiring Signals** | Job postings | Hiring "Data Scientists" & "AI Engineers" (5 positions) |
| **Tech Adoption** | Cloud/AI/automation | AWS migration, AI/ML implementation |

| **Notes** | Other info | Member of San Francisco Tech Council |
| **Pain point(s)** | Inferred/observable outstanding, relevant pain point(s) that Infostatus might help/solve | Manual data processing workflows consuming 20+ hours/week, document handling inefficiencies, scaling challenges with legacy system integrations |

## Conversation Strategy

### Primary Talking Points
1. **ðŸŽ¯ AWS Migration Challenges** (94% relevance)
   "I noticed TechCorp is migrating to AWS infrastructure. During cloud transitions, document processing workflows often become bottlenecks. We've helped similar companies maintain processing speed while scaling on AWS."

2. **ðŸš€ AI Feature Launch Success** (91% relevance)  
   "Congratulations on launching your AI features! Growing AI teams often spend too much time on document preparation instead of model development. Our automation could free up your engineers for higher-value work."

3. **ðŸ“Š Series A Growth Scaling** (88% relevance)
   "With your Series A funding and rapid growth, operational efficiency becomes critical. We've worked with similar companies to automate their document workflows before they become bottlenecks."

### Conversation Openers
- **CTO LinkedIn Engagement**: "Jane's recent post about AI compliance really resonated..."
- **TechCrunch Feature**: "Saw the TechCrunch feature on your AI innovation..."
- **San Francisco Tech Network**: "Fellow SF tech company..."

### Next Actions

## Simplified State Management

### Research Status Tracking
Each prospect has a simple research_status in the database:
- `pending`: Identified but not yet researched
- `researched`: Research completed successfully  
- `failed`: Research attempt failed

### Workflow Progress Determination
Progress is determined by **file existence** rather than complex database states:

```
Step 1 Complete: /data/prospects/{id}_research.md exists
Step 2 Complete: /data/prospects/{id}_profile.md exists (contains mini profile + conversation strategy)
```

### State Transitions
```
pending â†’ researched (when research_prospect completes successfully)
researched â†’ failed (if subsequent steps fail)
any â†’ pending (manual reset for re-research)
```

## File-Based Architecture

### Data Storage Strategy
```
Database: Minimal metadata only
â”œâ”€â”€ prospect_id, company_name, domain
â”œâ”€â”€ research_status, created_at, updated_at
â””â”€â”€ (6 total fields)

File System: Rich AI-generated content
â”œâ”€â”€ /data/icp.md (business-managed ICP)
â”œâ”€â”€ /data/prospects/{id}_research.md
â””â”€â”€ /data/prospects/{id}_profile.md (mini profile + conversation strategy)
```

### Integration with MCP Architecture
```
AI Agent â†’ MCP Client â†’ MCP Server â†’ File Operations + SQLite
                                 â†“
                           Markdown Files (human-readable)
                                 â†“
                    Copy-paste ready business intelligence
```

### Tool Flow
1. **research_prospect**: Company data â†’ SQLite record + research.md file
2. **generate_profile**: research.md â†’ profile.md file  
3. **create_talking_points**: profile.md â†’ talking_points.md file
4. **get_prospect_data**: SQLite + all markdown files â†’ complete prospect context
5. **search_prospects**: SQLite query + optional file content search

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **Step 1 Failure**: Retry with different data sources, mark research_status='failed'
- **Step 2 Failure**: Keep research file, retry profile generation with adjusted prompts
- **Step 1 Failure**: Mark prospect as 'failed', can retry research
- **Step 2 Failure**: Keep research file, can retry profile+strategy generation  
- **File Corruption**: Regenerate from previous step if source file exists
- **Partial Files**: Validate markdown format and completeness before marking complete

## Success Metrics

### Development Efficiency Metrics
- **Time to complete full 2-step workflow**: Target < 3 minutes per prospect
- **File generation success rate**: Target > 95% for each step
