# Feature Specification: MCP Server: Prospect Research Automation Engine

**Feature Branch**: `001-mcp-server-prospect`  
**Created**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "MCP Server: Prospect Research Automation Engine. The MCP server serves as the core intelligence layer for automated prospect identification and research, designed to eliminate the manual effort of qualifying cold calling opportunities. It provides four specialized tools that work together to create a complete prospect research workflow: find_new_prospect discovers qualified leads matching predefined ideal customer profiles from reliable data sources, research_prospect compiles comprehensive intelligence including company background, decision maker information, recent news, and identified pain points, while save_prospect and retrieve_prospect maintain a centralized prospect database that functions as a lightweight CRM foundation. The server addresses the critical gap between raw prospect data and actionable sales intelligence by automating the time-intensive research process, enabling sales teams to approach each cold call with contextual insights, personalized conversation starters, and confidence in lead quality."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A sales representative using an AI assistant (like Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, or Claude) needs to transform company information into actionable sales intelligence through a streamlined 2-step research workflow. The MCP server provides specialized tools that generate rich markdown files containing comprehensive research reports and structured profile + conversation strategy content, enabling the sales rep to receive copy-paste ready sales intelligence through natural language conversations with their AI assistant.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI assistant connected to the MCP server, **When** a sales rep provides a company name or domain, **Then** the AI assistant calls the research_prospect tool to generate a comprehensive markdown research report
2. **Given** a research markdown file has been generated, **When** the sales rep asks for a structured profile and talking points, **Then** the AI assistant calls the create_profile tool to transform research into a Mini Profile table with conversation strategy
3. **Given** prospect data exists in the system, **When** the sales rep needs to retrieve complete prospect information, **Then** the AI assistant calls the get_prospect_data tool to access all metadata and markdown files
4. **Given** multiple prospects are stored in the database, **When** the sales rep needs to search prospects by criteria or content, **Then** the AI assistant calls the search_prospects tool to find prospects matching specified filters
5. **Given** the MCP server exposes prospect resources, **When** the AI assistant needs context about saved prospects, **Then** it can access prospect resources via URI to provide enriched responses with markdown content
6. **Given** the simplified 2-step workflow, **When** a sales rep completes both research and profile steps, **Then** they receive human-readable markdown files ready for copy-paste into emails, presentations, or CRM systems

### Edge Cases
- What happens when company information is insufficient or outdated for the research_prospect tool?
- How does the create_profile tool handle research markdown files with incomplete or missing sections?
- What occurs when external data sources are unavailable during research generation?
- How does the research_prospect tool respond when no substantial research data can be found for a company?
- What happens when the create_profile tool tries to process research files that are corrupted or improperly formatted?
- How does the MCP server handle tool calls with invalid company identifiers or malformed parameters?
- What occurs when AI assistants lose connection to the MCP server during the 2-step workflow execution?
- How does the server handle concurrent tool calls for the same prospect from multiple AI assistant connections?
- What happens when the file system lacks sufficient storage space for generating markdown files?
- How does the system handle prospects with extremely common company names that could result in research ambiguity?
