# Feature Specification: MCP Server: Prospect Research Automation Engine

**Feature Branch**: `001-mcp-server-prospect`  
**Created**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "MCP Server: Prospect Research Automation Engine. The MCP server serves as the core intelligence layer for automated prospect identification and research, designed to eliminate the manual effort of qualifying cold calling opportunities. It provides four specialized tools that work together to create a complete prospect research workflow: find_new_prospect discovers qualified leads matching predefined ideal customer profiles from reliable data sources, research_prospect compiles comprehensive intelligence including company background, decision maker information, recent news, and identified pain points, while save_prospect and retrieve_prospect maintain a centralized prospect database that functions as a lightweight CRM foundation. The server addresses the critical gap between raw prospect data and actionable sales intelligence by automating the time-intensive research process, enabling sales teams to approach each cold call with contextual insights, personalized conversation starters, and confidence in lead quality."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A sales representative using an AI assistant (like Claude, VS Code Copilot, or LM Studio) needs to identify and research qualified prospects for cold calling. The MCP server provides specialized tools that the AI assistant can discover and invoke automatically to automate prospect research, enabling the sales rep to receive comprehensive prospect intelligence through natural language conversations with their AI assistant.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI assistant connected to the MCP server, **When** a sales rep asks to find new prospects matching their ideal customer profile, **Then** the AI assistant discovers and calls the find_new_prospect tool to return qualified leads
2. **Given** a prospect has been identified, **When** the sales rep asks for detailed research on the prospect, **Then** the AI assistant calls the research_prospect tool to compile comprehensive intelligence
3. **Given** prospect research has been completed, **When** the sales rep wants to save the prospect data, **Then** the AI assistant calls the save_prospect tool to store the profile in the server's database
4. **Given** prospects are stored in the database, **When** the sales rep needs to retrieve prospect information, **Then** the AI assistant calls the retrieve_prospect tool to access saved prospect data
5. **Given** the MCP server exposes prospect resources, **When** the AI assistant needs context about saved prospects, **Then** it can access prospect resources to provide enriched responses to the sales rep
6. **Given** the prospect database changes, **When** new prospects are added or updated, **Then** the MCP server notifies connected AI assistants about resource updates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no prospects match the ideal customer profile criteria in the find_new_prospect tool?
- How does the research_prospect tool handle prospects with incomplete or outdated information?
- What occurs when external data sources are unavailable during tool execution?
- How does the save_prospect tool respond when attempting to save duplicate prospect entries?
- What happens when the retrieve_prospect tool tries to access prospects that have been deleted?
- How does the MCP server handle tool calls with invalid or malformed parameters?
- What occurs when AI assistants lose connection to the MCP server during tool execution?
- How does the server handle concurrent tool calls from multiple AI assistant connections?
