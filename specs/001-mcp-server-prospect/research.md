# Research: MCP Server Implementation

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Feature**: Prospect Research Automation Engine  
**Phase**: 0 - Technology Research and Best Practices

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation
**Decision**: Use official MCP Python SDK for server implementation  
**Rationale**: 
- Official SDK provides standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation
- Built-in support for tools, resources, and capability negotiation
- Handles protocol versioning and client compatibility
- Reduces implementation complexity and ensures compliance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom JSON-RPC implementation: Rejected due to protocol complexity
- Existing MCP server frameworks: Limited ecosystem, prefer official SDK

**Best Practices**:
- Implement all four MCP capabilities: tools, resources, logging, prompts
- Use proper error handling with JSON-RPC error codes
- Implement capability negotiation for client compatibility
- Follow MCP specification for tool schema definitions

### 2. PostgreSQL with Supabase Local Stack
**Decision**: Use Supabase CLI for local PostgreSQL development with connection pooling  
**Rationale**:
- Provides enterprise-grade PostgreSQL with minimal configuration
- Built-in connection pooling and performance optimization
- Local development environment matches production capabilities
- Migration and schema management included

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct PostgreSQL: More configuration overhead
- SQLite: Insufficient for concurrent connections and enterprise features
- Docker PostgreSQL: Manual setup complexity

**Best Practices**:
- Use Supabase migrations for schema versioning
- Implement connection pooling for concurrent MCP clients
- Use prepared statements for SQL injection prevention
- Create indexes for prospect search performance

### 3. Data Acquisition Tiered Approach
**Decision**: Implement fallback chain: APIs → Firecrawl → Playwright MCP  
**Rationale**:
- APIs provide structured, reliable data with rate limiting
- Firecrawl handles intelligent content extraction and markdown conversion
- Playwright MCP enables browser automation for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Tiered approach ensures data availability while respecting site constraints

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single data source: Limited coverage and reliability
- Direct web scraping: Legal and technical challenges
- Manual research: Defeats automation purpose

**Best Practices**:
- Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies
- Cache successful API responses to reduce external calls
- Use Firecrawl's markdown conversion for consistent content format
- Implement Playwright MCP client for browser automation needs

### 4. Python Library Architecture
**Decision**: Four separate libraries with clear boundaries  
**Rationale**:
- Modular design enables independent testing and development
- Clear separation of concerns for maintainability
- Each library can be enhanced without affecting others
- Supports constitutional requirement for library-first development

**Libraries Defined**:
1. **prospect_finder**: ICP matching and lead discovery
2. **prospect_researcher**: Data aggregation and intelligence compilation
3. **prospect_storage**: Database operations and CRUD functionality
4. **mcp_server**: Protocol implementation and tool orchestration

**Best Practices**:
- Each library exposes CLI interface with --help, --version, --format
- Use dependency injection for database connections
- Implement structured logging across all libraries
- Create llms.txt documentation for each library

### 5. Testing Strategy with Real Dependencies
**Decision**: TDD with actual PostgreSQL and API connections  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for real dependencies in tests
- Integration tests validate actual MCP protocol compliance
- Database tests ensure data integrity and performance
- API tests validate external service integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Mock-based testing: Violates constitutional requirements
- Unit-only testing: Insufficient for integration validation

**Best Practices**:
- Test database setup/teardown for each test suite
- Use test-specific database schemas to avoid conflicts
- Implement contract tests for MCP tool schemas
- Create end-to-end tests simulating AI assistant workflows

### 6. Performance and Concurrency
**Decision**: Async/await pattern with connection pooling  
**Rationale**:
- MCP protocol supports multiple concurrent tool calls
- Database connection pooling essential for multi-client support
- Async pattern enables non-blocking external API calls
- Supports <200ms response time requirement

**Best Practices**:
- Use asyncio for MCP server implementation
- Implement connection pooling with configurable limits
- Add request queuing for external API rate limiting
- Monitor and log performance metrics

## Technology Stack Finalized

| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| MCP Server | Python MCP SDK | Latest | Protocol implementation |
| Database | PostgreSQL | 15+ | Data persistence |
| Local Stack | Supabase CLI | Latest | Development environment |
| Web Scraping | Firecrawl API | v1 | Intelligent content extraction |
| Browser Automation | Playwright MCP | Latest | JavaScript-heavy site handling |
| Testing | pytest + pytest-asyncio | Latest | TDD framework |
| CLI Framework | Click | Latest | Command-line interfaces |
| Database ORM | SQLAlchemy + asyncpg | Latest | Async database operations |
| Logging | structlog | Latest | Structured logging |

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Flow
```
AI Assistant → MCP Client → MCP Server → Tool Libraries → Data Sources
                                    ↓
                              PostgreSQL Database
```

### Tool Execution Pattern
1. MCP Client discovers available tools
2. AI Assistant selects appropriate tool based on user query
3. MCP Server validates tool parameters using JSON schema
4. Tool library executes business logic with error handling
5. Results returned through MCP protocol to AI Assistant

### Database Schema Approach
- Normalized schema for prospect entities
- JSONB fields for flexible research data storage
- Indexes on search fields for performance
- Migration scripts for schema evolution
