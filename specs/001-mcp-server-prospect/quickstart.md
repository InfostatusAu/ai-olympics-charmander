**Update**: 3-Step Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This quickstart guide demonstrates how to set up and use the MCP Prospect Research Server with AI assistants like Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, or Claude. The server provides a comprehensive 3-step prospect research workflow that transforms basic company information into actionable sales intelligence:

1. **Step 1: Research** - Gather comprehensive unstructured data
2. **Step 2: Mini Profile** - Generate structured 13-field prospect profile  
3. **Step 3: Talking Points** - Create personalized conversation starters

The complete workflow produces structured prospect intelligence ready for sales engagement.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- PostgreSQL 15+ or Supabase CLI
- AI assistant with MCP support (Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- API keys for data sources (optional but recommended)

## Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mcp-prospect-server
