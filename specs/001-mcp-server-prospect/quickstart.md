# Quickstart: MCP Prospect Research Server - Simplified Markdown-First

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Feature**: Prospect Research Automation Engine  
**Phase**: 1 - Integration Guide and User Stories  
**Update**: Simplified Markdown-First Architecture

## Overview

This quickstart guide demonstrates how to set up and use the simplified MCP Prospect Research Server with AI assistants. The server provides a streamlined 3-step research workflow that generates rich markdown files with minimal database complexity:

1. **Step 1: Research** - Generate comprehensive research markdown report
2. **Step 2: Mini Profile** - Create structured profile from research markdown  
3. **Step 3: Talking Points** - Generate conversation starters from profile

The complete workflow produces three markdown files containing actionable sales intelligence.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- SQLite (built-in with Python)
- AI assistant with MCP support (Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- API keys for data sources (optional but recommended)

## Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mcp-prospect-server

# Install dependencies using UV
uv sync

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Initialize SQLite database (automatic on first run)
mkdir -p data/prospects
mkdir -p data/database

# No additional setup required - SQLite database created automatically
```

### 3. MCP Server Configuration
```bash
# Start the MCP server
uv run python -m mcp_server.main

# Server will listen on stdio for MCP connections
# Or use TCP mode for remote AI assistants:
uv run python -m mcp_server.main --transport tcp --port 8000
```

### 4. AI Assistant Configuration

#### For Gemini CLI
```bash
# Add MCP server to Gemini CLI configuration
gemini config add-mcp-server prospect-research \
  --command "uv run python -m mcp_server.main" \
  --description "Prospect research automation tools"

# Verify connection
gemini mcp list-tools
```

#### For VS Code Copilot
Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "prospect-research": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "mcp_server.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-prospect-server"
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Claude Desktop
Add to Claude configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prospect-research": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "mcp_server.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-prospect-server"
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Workflow Issues

**Issue**: Workflow step fails with "research file not found"
**Solution**: Ensure research_prospect completed successfully before generate_profile. Check `/data/prospects/{company-name}/research.md` exists

**Issue**: Profile generation produces empty or minimal content
**Solution**: Verify research.md file has sufficient content (>15KB recommended). Re-run research with deeper focus areas

**Issue**: Talking points seem generic or irrelevant
**Solution**: Check profile.md contains specific pain points and decision-maker details. Ensure profile generation completed successfully

**Issue**: Files not persisting between server restarts
**Solution**: Verify data directory permissions and ensure `/data/prospects/` is writable

### Common Setup Issues

**MCP Server Not Responding**:
```bash
# Check server logs with verbose output
uv run python -m mcp_server.main --verbose

# Verify basic tool discovery
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | \
  uv run python -m mcp_server.main
```

**File System Issues**:
```bash
# Check data directory structure
ls -la data/prospects/

# Verify directory permissions  
mkdir -p data/prospects && chmod 755 data/prospects

# Check available disk space
df -h
```

**SQLite Database Issues**:
```bash
# Check database file creation
ls -la data/database/prospects.db

# Test database connectivity
sqlite3 data/database/prospects.db ".tables"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor file system usage
du -sh data/prospects/

# Check markdown file generation performance
find data/prospects/ -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1

# Monitor database size and performance
sqlite3 data/database/prospects.db ".dbinfo"
```

## Next Steps

After completing this quickstart:

1. **Configure Data Sources**: Add API keys for external research providers (optional for basic functionality)
2. **Customize Templates**: Modify markdown templates for research reports, profiles, and talking points
3. **Set Up File Management**: Configure backup and archival policies for prospect markdown files
4. **Tune Content Generation**: Adjust AI prompt templates for industry-specific research and talking points
5. **Scale Infrastructure**: Configure file system monitoring and cleanup policies for production use
6. **Integrate CRM**: Connect prospect metadata and markdown files to existing sales systems
7. **Train Sales Team**: Provide training on using AI-generated markdown intelligence effectively

For detailed implementation guide, see [Implementation Tasks](./tasks.md) (available after running `/tasks` command).

This quickstart demonstrates the complete value proposition of the simplified 3-step workflow: transforming basic company information into rich markdown intelligence files with minimal database complexity, all integrated seamlessly with AI assistant workflows.
