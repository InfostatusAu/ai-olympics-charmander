# Quickstart: MCP Prospect Research Server

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Feature**: Prospect Research Automation Engine  
**Phase**: 1 - Integration Guide and User Stories

## Overview

This quickstart guide demonstrates how to set up and use the MCP Prospect Research Server with AI assistants like Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, or Claude. The server provides automated prospect research capabilities through four specialized tools that work together to streamline cold calling preparation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- PostgreSQL 15+ or Supabase CLI
- AI assistant with MCP support (Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- API keys for data sources (optional but recommended)

## Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mcp-prospect-server

# Install dependencies using UV
uv sync

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Start Supabase local stack
supabase start

# Run database migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Seed with default ICP templates
uv run python scripts/seed_icps.py
```

### 3. MCP Server Configuration
```bash
# Start the MCP server
uv run python -m mcp_server.main

# Server will listen on stdio for MCP connections
# Or use TCP mode for remote AI assistants:
uv run python -m mcp_server.main --transport tcp --port 8000
```

### 4. AI Assistant Configuration

#### For Gemini CLI
```bash
# Add MCP server to Gemini CLI configuration
gemini config add-mcp-server prospect-research \
  --command "uv run python -m mcp_server.main" \
  --description "Prospect research automation tools"

# Verify connection
gemini mcp list-tools
```

#### For VS Code Copilot
Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "prospect-research": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "mcp_server.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-prospect-server"
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Claude Desktop
Add to Claude configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prospect-research": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "mcp_server.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-prospect-server"
    }
  }
}
```
