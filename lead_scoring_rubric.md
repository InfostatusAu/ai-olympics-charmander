## Scoring Method

- **Normalized Score = Σ (Score × Weight)**

### Suggested Thresholds
- **0–20** = Low Priority Lead  
- **21–40** = Medium Priority Lead  
- **41+** = High Priority Lead

## Notes
- Strong signals (Hiring, Technology, Operational) carry higher weight.  
- Medium signals (Public/PR, Funding, Tendering, Industry use cases) help refine prioritization.  
- Clusters of signals (e.g., Cloud adoption + AI hiring + new data infrastructure) indicate a prime prospect.
